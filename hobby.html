    <h2>I am!</h2>
    <p>I am a huge Binge Watcher. I love to chill in and watch a whole season of certain contents.
        I try not to watch the new episode right away. I would rather wait for a while until there are enough episodes
        to watch. </p>

    <h2>What's Binge Watching?</h2>
    <p>according to Wikipedia it is defined as 'Binge watching is the practice of watching television for a long time
        span, usually a single television show.
        Binge-watching as an observed cultural phenomenon has become popular with the rise of streaming media services
        such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu through which the viewer can watch television shows and movies
        on-demand.</p>

    <h2>What Content is Good to Binge Watch?</h2>
    <p>Here are some lists of TV shows that are recommended to binge watch for September by rottentomatoes.
        <ol>
            <li>Sons of Anarchy</li>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/aBOQDawZaa0"> <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/31153244/sons-of-anarchy-700x380.jpg" /></a>
            <p>This is a crime drama, about an outlaw motorcycle club in California's Central Valley, starred Charlie
                Hunnam as Jax Teller, a club member who begins to question the violence and crime of his chosen
                lifestyle.</p>
            <p>To get ready for the next chapter in the Sons of Anarchy saga, this show is recommended to binge watch.
                I just started re-watching this show. As always, the first season is the best. On my way to season 2.</p>
            <li>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</li>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/rA87ltqFEIQ"> <img src="https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/05/Its-Always-Sunny-In-Philadelphia-920x584.png" /></a>
            <p>The premise here is simple, but it works: Five friends (whose ineptitude goes beyond just social cues to
                pretty much every facet of day-to-day life) run an Irish bar in the titular city and have one
                misadventure after the next along the way.</p>
            <p>Why you should watch: You don't become one of the longest-running live-action comedies of all time by
                sitting on your laurels and getting lazy about the laughs. It's Always Sunny lays them on thick and
                fearlessly week to week for 12-going-on-13 seasons strong. That's a lot to binge - so get to it!</p>
            <li>Shameless</li>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/fdSjpVLLdfA"> <img src="https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ebwobJW_QF-V8oSkd6vip1_qk-g=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F322880%2F98c0c777-fe7c-4272-9b73-52a422480350.jpg" /></a>
            <p>This comedy series has been around for so long that it's hard to define it without giving away eight
                seasons of spoilers. But at its core, it's an hour-long dysfunctional family comedy-drama about six
                children who were forced to grow up too fast while under the watch of their single, alcoholoic father,
                Frank.</p>
            <p>This TV show was a tricky one for me. I was torn by the comedy and the aching drama. However, the show
                kept me keep watching it. It's like a drug. I can't wait for Season 9 which will be preiering Sept.9.</p>

    <h2>Will you keep Binge Watch?</h2>
    <p>Oh yes! Binge watching is one of my way to cope with stress. Long weekend and a good content to watch for more
        than 6 hours will take my stress away.</p>
